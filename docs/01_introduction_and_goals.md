# Introduction and Goals

## What is the Timesheet-Wizard?

The Timesheet-Wizard is a personal pet project to fetch timesheets from [Clockify](https://clockify.me/de/), transform
them to various formats and export them again into other tools.

As of now, the only target formats that are supported are XLSX, PDF and CSV, resulting in the
following main features of Timesheet-Wizard:

- Fetch timesheets from Clockify
- Generate & stores XLSX files from these timesheets
- Generate & stores PDF files from these timesheets
- Generate & stores CSV files from these timesheets

## Motivation

As a freelance Software-Engineer & -Architect doing mostly time & material contracting, tracking my working hours is
quite essential. To ease this, I'm using [Clockify](https://clockify.me/). It's an awesome tool with a nice UI that
allows me to track and also categorize my working hours. Besides supporting some Excel-reports out of the box, it also
provides an API to export reports in json-format as well.

In order to have the freedom to customize the reports as much as I like and to transfer these reports automatically to
other tools, I decided to create my own little application allowing me to do that: the Timesheet-Wizard.

In addition to the business motivation mentioned above, this is also a perfect opportunity to play around with
technology in the [function-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service) territory.
And to be honest: this was the main reason for creating the Timesheet-Wizard.

## Quality goals

| Nr  | Quality goal    | Motivation                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| QG1 | Security        | Neither the Timesheet-Wizard nor data generated by it may be accessible outside of the cloud provider.                                                             |
| QG2 | Cost efficiency | The infrastructure costs to keep the Timesheet-Wizard running should be as low as possible.                                                                        |
| QG3 | Extensibility   | The effort to add new target formats for the timesheets should be as low as possible. The effort to deploy to additional hyperscalers should be as low as possible |
| QG4 | Testability     | The components of the Timesheet-Wizard as well as the Timesheet-Wizard itself should be testable as easy as possible with a very high degree of automation.        |
