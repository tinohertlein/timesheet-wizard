# Quality Requirements

## Quality scenarios

| Nr  | Quality goal               | Motivation                                                                                                                                                         | Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| QG1 | Security                   | Neither the Timesheet-Wizard nor data generated by it must be accessible outside of AWS                                                                            | No access to S3 buckets is permitted without AWS credentials and authorization by Tino. This is enforced by AWS S3 bucket policies                                                                                                                               |
| QG2 | Cost efficiency            | The infrastructure costs to keep the Timesheet-Wizard running should be as low as possible                                                                         | The maximum monthly budget for the Timesheet-Wizard is 10â‚¬. A monitoring is established by using the AWS cost alerting mechanism                                                                                                                                 |
| QG3 | Extensibility              | The effort to add new target formats for the timesheets should be as low as possible                                                                               | This is of course depending on the complexity of the new target format. Leaving the effort of the actual implementation out of the game, adding this new feature to the current application is to be done in less than 1 working day including deployment to AWS |

| QG4 | (Technical) attractiveness | It's more important to use technologies I've never been working with before and invest time into learning these, than to bring the app to life as soon as possible | At least two new frameworks are used and some tries with GraalVM native image compilation are undertaken to realize the Timesheet-Wizard                                                                                                                         |
| QG5 | Testability                | The components of the Timesheet-Wizard as well as the Timesheet-Wizard itself should be testable as easy as possible with a very high degree of automation         | The only manual testing step is the testing of the final Excel and PDF file for plausibility and correctness once every month. All other tests are executed automatically in the CI/CD-pipeline                                                                          |
